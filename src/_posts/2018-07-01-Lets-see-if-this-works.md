Serious? Just kidding... I wouldn't be serious if I tried :-)
I'm making some tests (and some cheesy posts like this as well) to 
make sure that this infrastructure is solid enough to correctly mirror 
what's in the local preview (to avoid surprises when I upload) and 
the only way to be 100% sure is to make Travis-CI do the job, 
which in turn requires a push to the project's branch that's currently 
being monitored by Travis.
You're going to see some trial and error commits on the master branch 
that were pushed before I realized that this could take some time to 
sort out, so this process should continue on a separate branch that 
will eventually be merged onto the master branch.

See ya!
